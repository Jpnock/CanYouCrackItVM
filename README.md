# CanYouCrackItVM
###### C++ VM implementation of the GCHQ CanYouCrackIt Challenge


I have uploaded this for anyone struggling with this section of the challenge if they attempt it.
It is for Stage 2 of the challenge where you are required to create a virtual machine.

Currently you have to manually dump the memory to find the string you are looking for.

If you want to give the challenge a go, @MalwareTech uploaded it not that long ago:
